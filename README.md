# Multilingual Speculative Benchmark
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16758"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Paper-arXiv:2406.16758-Green"></a>

## ðŸ’¡ Overview

This repository is part of the research presented in our paper **"Towards Fast Multilingual LLM Inference: Speculative Decoding and Specialized Drafters"**. 

> **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing, finding applications in various commercial domains. Despite their versatility, the deployment of these models often faces challenges, particularly with high inference times in multilingual settings. Our work introduces a novel training methodology involving speculative decoding, combined with language-specific drafter models that are trained through a targeted pretrain-and-finetune strategy. This approach significantly enhances inference speed and efficiency across different languages.
